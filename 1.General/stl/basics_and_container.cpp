/*
STL contains: container + algorithm + iterators
    container: Object that stores data;
    algorithm: Procedure to process data
    iterators: Object which points to a elements of container
     
    types of containers:
    1. sequece containers -> linear fashion ->vector,list,de-queue
    2. Associative containers -> direct access ->set,multi-set,tree,map,multimap
    3.Derived containers -> real world modelling ->stack,queue,priority-queue

        a.vector->  Random access fast
                    middle insertion/del =slow
                    insertion at the end =fast
        b. list -> ra=slow
                   middle insertion/delete=fast
                   insertion at the end=fast
    associative containers->all operations fast
                            except RA(slow)
    derived containers-> depends -> dsa
