'<<' is a insertion operator(cout<<a)
'>>' is a extraction operator(cin>>a)
'::' is called scope resolution operator and it is use to print the value of  global variable
type def , it is use to make easier to call a structure like 'college' to 'co' on structure 
 Unions use shared memory so only 1 variable can be used at a time
 example:
    union money
    {
        /* data */
        int rice; //4
        char car; //1
        float pounds; //4
    };
if we change the value of refernce variable then actual value will change
